    "ROC  analysis  of  probabilistic  classifiers  is  important  topic  in  machine  learning.  It  is  used when we need to decide whether the posterior class probabilities that the classifiers assign to test instances allow us to separate correctly the instances according to their class labels.  In this lab you will implement a class ROC in Python that can be used for ROC analysis for two  class  problems  (e.g.  problems  with  positive  and  negative  classes).  Description  of  the application program interface of this class is provided in the next section.   "

    "We  need  to  implement  the  lab  tasks  related  to  class  ROC  in  the  following  context.  A probabilistic classifer $h$ has been first trained on some labeled training data and then tested on  a  test  set  of  labeled  test  instances.  For  each  test  instance  $x$  classifier  $h$  has  outputted posterior probability of the positive class and posterior probability of the negative class. The class probabilities of the test instances are saved in a `pandas.DataFrame` object `Probs` and the true class labels of the test instances are saved in a `pandas.DataFrame` object `TrueClass`. The correspondence between object `Probs` and object `TrueClass` is index-based: the positive-class probability of the $i^{th}$ instance $x$ is the $i^{th}$ element of $P$ and the true-class label of the $i^{th}$ instance is the $i^{th}$ element of `TrueClass`.
